# ijava-binder
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/darodriguezm/IJava/master)

A [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) compatible repository to try out the [IJava](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava) kernel with just a web browser. Depending on if the docker image is already built, spawning the notebook may take some time and so please be patient with it.

In the future this repository may be populated with more example notebooks but it mainly serves to meet the requirements for using the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) service to play around with the [IJava](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava) kernel.

## Notebook authors

If you are writing Jupyter notebooks in Java and publishing them on GitHub you are more than welcome (and encouraged!) to take any scripts from here and add them to your repository so that visitors may try out your notebooks without any installation.

Likely all that is needed is the `Dockerfile` at the top level of your repo. Then add some badges from https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/badges.html to your `README` and everything should be good to go! If you have a repository with [IJava](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava) notebooks, please feel free to open a PR (or raise an issue) adding a link somewhere in this `README` to that repository.

The files and information of this repository has been copied, in big part, from the SpencerPark IJava (https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava) repository and had been created exclusibly for do java class in the Quality Center area for Cencosud, Chile.

Thans SpencerPark for this great repository and great Java kernel.
